At Lopez Tables, we are committed to providing an exceptional purchasing experience that reflects the quality and craftsmanship of our furniture.

**Product Information**

While our catalog provides comprehensive details about each piece, we understand that selecting fine furniture is a personal decision. We welcome inquiries for additional information, detailed specifications, or specific customization options for any item in our collection.

**Private Viewings**

We invite clients to schedule private appointments to view our tables in person. These personalized sessions allow you to experience the materials, craftsmanship, and scale of our pieces firsthand, ensuring your selection perfectly complements your space.

**Purchase Documentation**

Upon receipt of your furniture, you will receive complete purchase documentation, including a signed purchase agreement and detailed receipt. This documentation serves as a record of authenticity and includes information about your piece, warranty details, and care instructions.

**Complimentary Delivery & Installation**

We provide complimentary white-glove delivery and professional installation for all purchases within 25 miles of Dallas, Texas. Our experienced team ensures your furniture is delivered safely and positioned precisely according to your specifications.

For deliveries beyond our complimentary service area, we are pleased to arrange specialized shipping and installation at competitive rates.
